# Skill Governance

**The rule in one line:** every skill in this package declares who wrote it, how AKILI binds it into the flow, and why its size is justified — or it does not ship.

AKILI-SPECS is a curated methodology, not a skill dump. Skills are admitted through the analysis below, adapted to the methodology, and attributed to their original authors. Curation and adaptation by Juan Carlos Cadavid — jcadavid.com.

## Binding Taxonomy

Every skill declares `metadata.binding` in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter. The binding level answers the question: *when and how does this skill get loaded?*

| Binding | When it loads | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | Always, at a precise step of a command | The command text hard-loads it ("load the `X` skill") |
| `conditional` | When the work touches its domain | A conditional line in the command ("if the work involves X, load `Y`") |
| `stack` | Depends on the project's technology stack | `/akili-constitution` writes a **`## Skill Map`** into the project's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`; `/akili-specify` derives per-task required skills in `tasks.md`; the Leader assigns them to Implementer/Tester via dynamic skill loading |

### Current assignment

| Binding | Skills |
|---|---|
| `core` | `kaizen` (archive), `judgment-day` (specify), `cognitive-doc-design` (all human-facing docs), `brainstorming` (constitution, propose), `product-manager-toolkit` (constitution), `software-architect` (constitution TRD/infra, specify design), `caveman` (execute/test transient inter-agent output), `systematic-debugging` (bug flows), `seo-audit` (seo) |
| `conditional` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `frontend-design`, `stitch-design` (UI work), `gsap-animation` (animation work) |
| `stack` | `angular-developer`, `nestjs-expert`, `shadcn-ui`, `tailwind-design-system`, `react-doctor`, `vercel-react-best-practices`, `aws-serverless`, `api-design-principles`, `error-handling-patterns` |

Rules of thumb:

- A skill earns `core` only when a command step would be *wrong* without it (a retrospective without `kaizen` is not the AKILI archive).
- `conditional` skills are stack-agnostic capabilities that many but not all specs need (UI, animation).
- `stack` skills must never be **load-directed** in command text (a command step telling the agent to load a named stack skill) — commands stay tool- and framework-agnostic. They reach the agent through the project Skill Map and per-task skill lists. **Three documented carve-outs:** (1) the Skill Map *builder* in `/akili-constitution` (Step 8D, and the Step 5 TRD bootstrap that feeds it — constitution runs *before* the map exists) may enumerate the packaged stack skills as the candidate pool it selects from; (2) an explicit **no-map fallback list** that defers to the Skill Map first ("prefer the `## Skill Map` when it exists; otherwise pick from: …") is acceptable; (3) purely *illustrative* examples ("e.g. `nestjs-expert`") that explicitly defer to the task list / Skill Map are acceptable. A step that says "use these skills:" followed by stack-skill names, with **no** Skill Map deferral, is a violation.

## Frontmatter Schema

Every packaged skill carries this frontmatter (original fields are preserved, never overwritten):

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: "<trigger keywords + what it does>"
license: <original license — never altered>
metadata:
  author: <original author, or "community (origin unverified)">
  source: <URL or collection of origin, when known>
  adapted-by: "Juan Carlos Cadavid — jcadavid.com"
  adapted-for: "AKILI-SPECS"
  binding: core | conditional | stack
  version: "<preserved or 1.0>"
---
```

Attribution is non-negotiable: MIT and Apache-2.0 licenses require preserving the original copyright and license notices. `adapted-by` records curation and AKILI adaptation — it never replaces the original `author`.

**Original-authorship variant:** skills authored originally for AKILI-SPECS (e.g. `kaizen`, `software-architect`) carry `author: Juan Carlos Cadavid — jcadavid.com` and may declare `inspired-by:` (a list of the works the method synthesizes) instead of `source`/`adapted-by`/`adapted-for` — there is no upstream to adapt from, but intellectual influences are still credited.

## Adaptation Levels

| Level | Who gets it | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Attribution | All skills | The standard frontmatter above |
| 2 — Integration | `core` and deeply-used `conditional` skills only | An `## AKILI-SPECS Integration` section in the body: a table mapping the skill's tools to exact moments in the AKILI flow, plus adaptation rules |

`stack` skills deliberately get **no** integration section — they are loaded per task and extra methodology prose in them is token waste (MUDA).

## Acceptance Checklist for New Skills

A skill enters `.claude/skills/` only when all of these hold. If any box fails, the skill stays out.

1. **Need** — a real AKILI phase or supported stack needs it; name the command step or Skill Map slot it will occupy.
2. **Binding declared** — `core`, `conditional`, or `stack`, with the exact integration point. A `core`/`conditional` skill must actually be wired into command text in the same change; a skill referenced by no command and no Skill Map is dead weight and does not ship.
3. **Attribution complete** — original author, source, and license identified and preserved; `adapted-by` added. If the origin cannot be verified after a genuine search, mark `author: community (origin unverified)`.
4. **Size justified** — prefer one skill with `references/` (progressive disclosure) over families of sibling skills; large data/scripts payloads need a stated reason.
5. **Docs + CHANGELOG** — a `docs/skills/<name>.md` page, a truthful row in `docs/skills/README.md` (Binding column included), and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

The same checklist applies in reverse: when a skill loses its integration points, remove it or re-bind it — do not let the inventory drift from the commands.

## Removal / Fusion Log

| Date | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-20 | `gsap-core`, `gsap-timeline`, `gsap-scrolltrigger`, `gsap-plugins`, `gsap-react`, `gsap-frameworks`, `gsap-performance`, `gsap-utils` → fused into `gsap-animation` | 8 sibling skills, ~104 KB, zero command wiring; one `conditional` skill with `references/` preserves the content and is actually loaded |
